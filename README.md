#My Portfolio Website
Portfolio Website
This is a basic portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It consists of two pages:

Home Page – Introduces who I am and showcases a brief overview of my work or interests.

Contact Page – Provides a simple form or contact information for getting in touch.

The goal of this project is to practice building and styling web pages using foundational web technologies. It's a clean and minimal design suitable as a starting point for personal branding.
